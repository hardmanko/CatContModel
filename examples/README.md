# Examples

In this directory, there are some examples of the use of this package with simulated data sets. There are comments throughout the examples to help you follow the logic of the steps.

In most cases, the data is simulated from the model that is then fit to that data. The data is simulated with known parameter values, so it is possible to examine how well the model is able to recover the true parameter values. I use this for testing the package.

In some cases, in the example, a model other than the model that generated the data is fit to the data to test whether the incorrect model fits worse than the correct model, as it should.
